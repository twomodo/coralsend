# CoralSend Licensing Model

## Summary

CoralSend uses a dual-path model:

- Community path: AGPL-3.0-only (`LICENSE`)
- Commercial self-host path: `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`
- Brand usage policy: `TRADEMARKS.md`

## 1) Community Edition (AGPL-3.0-only)

Use this path if you can comply with AGPL obligations, including source availability obligations for network use of modified versions.

## 2) Commercial Self-Host License

Use this path if your organization needs commercial terms that do not fit AGPL obligations. Commercial terms are documented in `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` and finalized in your signed order form.

## 3) Trademark Scope

Code rights do not grant brand rights. Product names, logos, and brand assets are governed by `TRADEMARKS.md`.

## 4) How to Choose

- Choose AGPL if you are comfortable with AGPL obligations.
- Choose commercial terms if you need contractual support, custom restrictions, or proprietary deployment rights beyond AGPL.

## 5) Source of Truth

The authoritative files are:

- `LICENSE`
- `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`
- `TRADEMARKS.md`

This page is explanatory and does not replace the legal text in those files.
