# CoralSend Trademark Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-20

This policy explains how the CoralSend name, logos, and related brand assets may be used.

## Code License vs Brand Rights

- The source code license (AGPL-3.0-only) grants rights for software use, modification, and distribution under its terms.
- Trademark rights are separate and are not granted by the code license.

## Allowed Uses (Without Separate Permission)

- Truthful, referential use to state compatibility or origin (for example, "forked from CoralSend") in plain text.
- Internal evaluation and development use that does not imply endorsement.

## Prohibited Uses (Without Written Permission)

- Using "CoralSend" in product names, domains, social handles, or company names in ways that may cause confusion.
- Using CoralSend logos or visual identity in redistributed hosted services.
- Claiming endorsement, partnership, or official status when none exists.

## Requesting Permission

For commercial brand use, request written permission from the project owner before publication.

## Enforcement

Misleading or unauthorized trademark usage may require rebranding, removal of assets, or legal enforcement.
